# Vending-Machine
A simple Vending Machine program written in Python

This program simulates the operations of a vending machine. Below, I wrote four different & simple
functions to display the menu, take cash, offer products, and return the change in coins

It performs in the following order:
1) Display the instructions to the user
2) Take in money from the user
3) Display the menu of products
4) Offer the products
5) Retrieve products selected, and remaining balance
6) Dispense products
7) Return change in coins
